## Download (No Python needed)

Head to the **[Releases page](../../releases)** and download the latest version for your platform:

| Platform | File |
|----------|------|
| macOS    | `YT.Downloader.app.zip` |
| Windows  | `YT.Downloader.exe` |

**macOS:** Unzip and double-click. If macOS blocks it ("unidentified developer"), right-click → Open → Open anyway.

**Windows:** Just double-click the `.exe`. If Windows Defender shows a SmartScreen warning, click "More info" → "Run anyway". This happens because the app isn't code-signed — the app itself is safe.

---

## Build it yourself

If you'd rather build from source than trust a pre-built binary, follow the instructions below. Building requires Python — but the output app/exe does not.

### Prerequisites (both platforms)

- [Python 3.10+](https://python.org) — on Windows, check **"Add Python to PATH"** during install
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) — required for MP3 conversion and MP4 re-encoding

**Install ffmpeg:**
- macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`
- Windows: Download from [gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) (grab the "essentials" build), extract, and either add to PATH or place `ffmpeg.exe` + `ffprobe.exe` next to the build script

---

### macOS

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/yt-downloader.git
cd yt-downloader/mac

# 2. Make the build script executable
chmod +x build.sh

# 3. Build
./build.sh
```

The script installs all Python dependencies automatically. When it finishes, Finder will open the `dist/` folder containing `YT Downloader.app`. Double-click it to run, or drag it to your Applications folder.

---

### Windows

```bat
:: 1. Clone the repo (or download the ZIP from GitHub)
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/yt-downloader.git
cd yt-downloader\windows

:: 2. Double-click build_windows.bat
::    (or run it from Command Prompt)
build_windows.bat
```

The script installs all Python dependencies automatically. When it finishes, Explorer will open the `dist\` folder containing `YT Downloader.exe`. Move it anywhere — Desktop, `C:\Apps`, a USB drive. It has no installer and leaves nothing in the registry.

## Path shorthands

When choosing a save location, you can type any of these instead of a full path:

| Shorthand | Resolves to |
|-----------|-------------|
| `$desktop` | `~/Desktop` |
| `$downloads` | `~/Downloads` |
| `$documents` | `~/Documents` |
| `$music` | `~/Music` |
| `$videos` | `~/Movies` (macOS) / `~/Videos` (Windows) |
| `$home` | Your home directory |
| `~` | Your home directory |

You can also use relative paths (`../my-folder`), environment variables (`%USERPROFILE%\Music` on Windows), and standard absolute paths.

## How it works

The app is a Python + [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) GUI wrapped around [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), the most actively maintained YouTube download library available. [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org) bundles Python, yt-dlp, certifi (SSL certificates), and ffmpeg into a single self-contained binary — no runtime dependencies needed.

---

## Troubleshooting

**"SSL certificate verify failed" on macOS**
This is fixed automatically by the app. If you see it anyway, run `pip install --upgrade certifi` and rebuild.

**No video in the MP4, only audio**
This happens when the video was downloaded in VP9/AV1 format, which QuickTime doesn't support. The app explicitly requests H.264 + AAC and re-encodes via ffmpeg if needed. Make sure ffmpeg is installed and was bundled during the build.

**ffmpeg not found during build**
- macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`
- Windows: Place `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe` in the same folder as `build_windows.bat`, then re-run the script.

**Windows SmartScreen / Defender warning**
The executable is not code-signed (signing costs ~$200–$400/year). Click "More info" → "Run anyway". If you don't trust the pre-built binary, build it yourself from source — the code is fully visible in this repo.

**macOS "app is damaged" or "unidentified developer"**
Right-click the app → Open → Open. If that doesn't work, run:
```bash
xattr -cr "/Applications/YT Downloader.app"
```

**A playlist video was skipped**
Private, members-only, age-restricted, or region-blocked videos are automatically skipped. The rest of the playlist will still download.

**The ETA shows `--:--`**
This happens briefly at the very start of a download before enough data has been transferred to calculate a reliable speed. It corrects itself within a few seconds.
