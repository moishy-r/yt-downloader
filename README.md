## Download (No Python needed)

Go to the **[Releases page](../../releases)** and download the latest version for your platform:

| Platform | File                    |
| -------- | ----------------------- |
| macOS    | `YT.Downloader.app.zip` |
| Windows  | `YT.Downloader.exe`     |

**macOS:** Unzip and double-click. If macOS blocks it as an unidentified developer, right-click the app, choose **Open**, then click **Open** again.

**Windows:** Double-click the `.exe`. If Windows Defender shows a SmartScreen warning, click **More info** → **Run anyway**. This happens because the app is not code-signed.

---

## Build it yourself

If you prefer building from source instead of using a pre-built binary, follow the instructions below. Building requires Python, but the final app/exe does not.

### Prerequisites (both platforms)

* [Python 3.10+](https://python.org) — on Windows, enable **"Add Python to PATH"** during installation
* [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) — required for MP3 conversion and MP4 re-encoding

**Install ffmpeg:**

* macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`
* Windows: Download from [gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) (use the "essentials" build), extract it, and either add it to PATH or place `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe` next to the build script

---

### macOS

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/moishy-r/yt-downloader.git
cd yt-downloader/mac

# 2. Make the build script executable
chmod +x build.sh

# 3. Build
./build.sh
```

The script installs all Python dependencies automatically. When it finishes, Finder opens the `dist/` folder containing `YT Downloader.app`.

---

### Windows

```bat
:: 1. Clone the repo (or download the ZIP from GitHub)
git clone https://github.com/moishy-r/yt-downloader.git
cd yt-downloader\windows

:: 2. Double-click build_windows.bat
::    (or run it from Command Prompt)
build_windows.bat
```

The script installs all Python dependencies automatically. When it finishes, Explorer opens the `dist\` folder containing `YT Downloader.exe`. You can move it anywhere — Desktop, `C:\Apps`, or a USB drive. It has no installer and does not modify the registry.

---

## CLI

The CLI works on macOS, Windows, and Linux. No build step needed.

```bash
pip install yt-dlp certifi
```

**Interactive mode** (recommended if you're using it manually):
```bash
python cli/yt_downloader_cli.py
```

**Non-interactive**, for scripting:
```bash
# Download a playlist as MP3
python cli/yt_downloader_cli.py --url "https://youtube.com/playlist?list=..." --fmt mp3 --quality 320

# Download specific videos by index
python cli/yt_downloader_cli.py --url "..." --fmt mp4 --quality 1080p --indices "1,3,5-8"

# Use a path shorthand for the output folder
python cli/yt_downloader_cli.py --url "..." --out "$music/YouTube"
```

Run `python cli/yt_downloader_cli.py --help` for all available flags.

---

## Web interface

A browser-based option for people who prefer not to install an app. Runs a small local server on your machine -- nothing is hosted externally, no data leaves your computer.

```bash
# Run from the repo root
pip install -r web/requirements.txt
python web/app.py
```

Then open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). Same features as the desktop app: fetch a URL, pick videos from a checkbox list, choose format and quality, and download. Completed files are served directly to your browser.

See [web/README.md](web/README.md) for more detail.

---

## Path shorthands

Instead of typing out a full path for the output folder, you can use these anywhere the app or CLI asks for a location:

| Shorthand | Resolves to |
|-----------|-------------|
| `$desktop` | `~/Desktop` |
| `$downloads` | `~/Downloads` |
| `$documents` | `~/Documents` |
| `$music` | `~/Music` |
| `$videos` | `~/Movies` (macOS) / `~/Videos` (Windows) |
| `$home` | Your home directory |
| `~` | Your home directory |

Relative paths, `%USERPROFILE%` style env vars on Windows, and standard absolute paths all work too.

---

## How it works

All download logic lives in `core/downloader.py`, including playlist fetching, yt-dlp configuration, path resolution, and progress calculation. The macOS GUI, Windows GUI, CLI, and web server are all thin frontends built on top of the shared core, so fixes and new features only need to be implemented once to propagate everywhere automatically.

The desktop GUIs are built with Python’s built-in [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) library and [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp). [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org) packages Python, yt-dlp, certifi, and ffmpeg into a single standalone binary with no external dependencies. The web interface is powered by [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) and streams live progress updates to the browser using Server-Sent Events.

## Troubleshooting

### "SSL certificate verify failed" on macOS

This should already be handled automatically. If it still appears, run:

```bash
pip install --upgrade certifi
```

Then rebuild the app.

### MP4 download has audio but no video

This usually happens when a video is downloaded in VP9 or AV1 format, which QuickTime does not support. The app requests H.264 + AAC and re-encodes through ffmpeg when needed. Make sure ffmpeg is installed and bundled during the build.

### ffmpeg not found during build

* macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`
* Windows: Place `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe` in the same folder as `build_windows.bat`, then run the script again

### Windows SmartScreen / Defender warning

The executable is not code-signed. Click **More info** → **Run anyway**. If you prefer, you can build the app yourself from source.

### macOS "app is damaged" or "unidentified developer"

Right-click the app and choose **Open**. If that still fails, run:

```bash
xattr -cr "/Applications/YT Downloader.app"
```

### A playlist video was skipped

Private, members-only, age-restricted, or region-blocked videos are skipped automatically. The rest of the playlist will still download.

### The ETA shows `--:--`

This can happen briefly at the beginning of a download before enough data is available to estimate speed.
